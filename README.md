# CapstoneProject
The portfolio Allocation problem aims to find the best portfolio composition, in order to maximaze a given function.
In particular the problem of Portfolio Optimization is performed on a future date using Amazon SageMaker DeepAR algorithm for the prediction.

The whole project has been developed in Jupyter Notebook and uses the daily stock prices retrieved from `yfinance` module (if you do not need to install the module, comment the line `!pip install yfinance` in the Notebook, otherwise the module will be installed).

In addition, the `report.pdf` file contains the description of the analyses performed and the results of the project.
